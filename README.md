# More-Shields
This mod adds more shields to Minecraft, like diamond shields, wooden shields and stone shields, and even adds a new block, "Reinforced Wood", which can be used as a building block alongside some shield recipes.
 
 This mod supports some of my other mod, Specialised Netherite, and the work-in-progress mod @averageaxe is working on, Specialised Netherite +, which serves as an addon to my already existing mod, please leave any mods you want me to support in the future in a feature request.
 
# About Me
This mod is made by me only, except some translations and textures by the community, so it's very slow progress, so if you want to see prerelease versions, subscribe to my patreon! It helps me out alot and gives me motivation for this project

Also, it's worth noting, I don't mind people messaging me and saying hi/giving input on the mods or suggestions, so if you want to tell me a feature personally, then you can see me in discord, similarly to my patreon, it gives me alot of motivation to know that it's a project people are actively using/interested in!
